# Solutions to exercises

## PHONEBOOK

In this section, I explored the Express.js framework on the node.js environment. Using this framework, I learnt to write the GET and POST HTTP requests. I also utilised dependencies such as nodemon to monitor changes to the application on the backend, and [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan?tab=readme-ov-file#morgan) middleware to log HTTP requests.

The application was deployed on render and can be found [here](https://fullstackopen-backend-k0jn.onrender.com/)
